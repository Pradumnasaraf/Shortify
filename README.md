## üì¶ Installation

**Prerequisite**: Docker and Docker Compose installed

To run to project after cloning the repository. First create a `.env` file inside the `api` folder by copying the `.env.example` file. Also you can run the following command to create the `.env` file (from the root).

```bash
cp api/.env.example api/.env
```

Then run the following command to start the project.

```bash
docker compose up
```

## üìù Usage

To create a short URL send a `POST` request to the `/api/v1` endpoint with the following body. The `short` field is optional. If we don't provide the `short` field then a random string will be generated.

```json
{
  "url": "https://pradumnasaraf.dev",
  "short": "pradumna"
}
```

In the response you will receive the recive the following body. We can modify the expiry time and rate limit in the `.env` file.

```json
{
  "url": "https://pradumnasaraf.dev",
  "short": "localhost:8080/pradumna",
  "expiry": 24,
  "rate_limit": 9,
  "rate_limit_reset": 30
}
```

Now to check if the short URL received in the response is working, head over to broswer and enter URL. For example, if the short URL is `http://localhost:8080/pradumna` then enter this URL in the browser and you will be redirected to the original URL.
